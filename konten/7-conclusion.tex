\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\par We have proposed a two-step prevention for SQLi, using a blacklist for keyword filtering and the LSTM model. LSTM performed better than the other ten classical machine learning approaches (99.53\% F1 score on validation data) but it requires more predicting time. Even so, we can consider the model to be relatively fast (under 1 millisecond per query). With the additional use of keyword filtering, the predictive performance is increased but insignificant. Our approach competes well with state-of-the-art approaches. We also have developed a simple web application for a login use case to make our proposed method accessible to testers.

\par To further enhance the effectiveness of our approach, we can implement explainable AI using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) in the backend system. This would provide administrators with more detailed information when an attack is detected. Currently, our proposed system relies solely on a blacklist for keyword filtering. However, we can also consider using a whitelist approach, such as a regex email filter, to reduce false positives in our SQLi detection. This would provide an additional layer of protection and improve the performance of our system.
